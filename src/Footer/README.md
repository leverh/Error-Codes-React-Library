## Key Points of The JS Template:
* **Props for Customization**: The **Footer** component accepts **year**, **companyName**, and **links** as props. This allows the user to specify the year, company name, and any footer links they want to include.
* **Dynamic Links**: The footer links are rendered dynamically based on the **links** prop.
* **Default Values**: Default values are provided for **year** and **companyName** if they are not passed as props.
