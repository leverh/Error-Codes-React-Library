## Key Points of The JS Template:
* **Props for Customization**: The component accepts props for **title**, **message**, **homeUrl**, **portfolioUrl**, and **imageUrl**. This allows usersto customize these elements as needed.
* **Default Values**: Default values are provided for **title**, **message**, and **imageUrl**. These defaults are used if the corresponding props aren't provided, ensuring the component always has sensible fallback content.
* **PropTypes for Type Checking**: **PropTypes** are used to document the expected types for each prop. This can help  developers understand how to use the component and provides basic type checking in development.
* **Optional Portfolio Link**: The component checks if **portfolioUrl** is provided before rendering the portfolio link. This makes the portfolio link optional, adding flexibility to the component.

## Key Points of The CSS Template:
* **Class Names**: The class names are kept consistent with your original CSS, making sure they match the JSX structure of the **NotFound** component.
* **Flexibility**: The styles are designed to be easily adaptable. For example, the image styling can work with various image sources and sizes.
* Responsive Design: The responsive styles ensure that the component looks good on a wide range of devices.
