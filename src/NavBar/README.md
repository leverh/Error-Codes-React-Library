## Key Points of The JS Template:
* **Prop-driven**: The component accepts props like **links**, **logo**, **currentUser**, etc., making it flexible for various use cases.
* **Dynamic Link Rendering**: **renderLinks** function dynamically renders navigation links based on the links prop.
* **Support for User State**: Conditional rendering for logged in/out user states.
* **Dark Mode Toggle**: Included as an optional feature.
* **PropTypes**: Usage of **PropTypes** for type checking and documentation.
* **Styles**: Assumes a unified CSS module (**Navbar.module.css**), which you'll need to merge and modify based on the styles from your two components.

## Key Points of the CSS:
* Class Naming: The class names have been adjusted to match the proposed component structure. For example, **.navbar** to style the `<nav>` element.
* **Responsiveness**: The responsive styles with media queries are retained to ensure the navbar functions well on different screen sizes.
* **Flexibility for Extension**: The structure allows you to easily add more styles specific to other elements within the navbar, like buttons or avatars, if needed.
