## Key Points of The JS Template:
* **Dynamic Content**: Instead of hardcoding the content, the Imprint component accepts a string of HTML content (**content** prop), which it renders using **dangerouslySetInnerHTML**. This allows users of my library to supply their own content.
* **Contact Details and Legal Disclaimer**: These sections are rendered based on the props passed, making the component adaptable to different scenarios.
* **PropTypes**: Used for type checking and documentation of props.
