## Key Points For The JS File:
* **Customizable Styles via Props**: Allow the user to pass custom styles or class names. This can be useful if users of this library want to apply their own styling.
* **Customizable Scroll Threshold**: It's possible to introduce a prop to define the scroll threshold at which the button appears.
* **Customizable Icon/Text**: Allow passing custom text or an icon for the button. This can be a simple text prop, or you could use a slot or children to allow for more complex content.
* **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure that the button is accessible, for instance, by adding appropriate **aria-label** attributes.
